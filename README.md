# Dungeon
My task was to work with my tester team and the developer team, and make a test plan, create test cases and execute them. Make reports and feedback.
The Project was 2 week long and the developer team released a new patch every 3rd day. We ran confirmation tests, regression tests and also designed new cases for the new features.
