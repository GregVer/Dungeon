# Dungeon
My task was to work with my test team and the development team, and make a test plan, create test cases and execute them. Make reports and feedback.
The Project was 2 week long and the development team realised new patches every 3rd day. We ran confirmation tests, regression tests and also designed new cases for the new features.
